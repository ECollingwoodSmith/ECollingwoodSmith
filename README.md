<!-- Introduction -->
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">Welcome to my digital domain! I'm Elliot, a data virtuoso with a flair for finance. My journey began with a solid foundation in Accountancy & Finance, culminating in an MA (Hons) from Heriot-Watt University. Building on this, I embarked on a thrilling Data Science odyssey at HyperionDev, mastering Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization along the way.</p>

**Data Science Expertise:**
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">Behold, the wizard of data! I wield Python like a maestro, conjuring insights from the depths of complex datasets. Proficient in NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and spaCy, I specialize in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). From sentiment analysis to predictive modeling, I craft solutions that unlock the secrets of the digital realm.</p>

**Experience at Accelerant Insurance:**
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">In the crucible of Accelerant Insurance, I honed my craft in the arcane arts of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With web scraping prowess and HTML sorcery, I amassed a treasure trove of insurance insights from a sea of news articles. Armed with TensorFlow and sklearn enchantments, I sculpted a BERT model tailored for the insurance domain, unveiling truths hidden in the shadows. The wisdom gleaned from this quest was presented to the Chief Decision Scientist, demonstrating my prowess as a data sorcerer.</p>

**Finance Background:**
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">But wait, there's more! My adventures in finance have taken me from the trading floors of Credit Suisse to the audit chambers of Grant Thornton. With a keen eye for market trends and a knack for volatility forecasting, I navigate the labyrinth of financial data with ease. My dissertation on volatility forecasting stands as a testament to my prowess in the arcane arts of finance.</p>

**Ongoing Projects:**
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">Behold, the architect of the future! In my laboratory of machine learning and AI, I craft the blueprints of tomorrow's financial landscape. Armed with TensorFlow and PyTorch, I design algorithms that dance with market trends, safeguard portfolios, and mitigate risks. From insurance to investments, I weave a tapestry of prosperity and innovation, reshaping the world one data point at a time.</p>

**Active GitHub Contributor:**
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">Seeking fellow travelers in the digital wilderness, I roam the halls of GitHub with fervor.
